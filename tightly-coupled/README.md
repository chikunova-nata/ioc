The code works but is very simple. The problems come into play in a much larger application. Imagine having hundreds of components with dependencies ... now you will run into some issues:

* The components depend directly on each other. If you create or include the engine before defining the piston, the code will fail.

* You cannot develop components in parallel. The tight coupling means it's not possible to have a developer working on engines while another is working on pistons.

* The components create their own dependencies so there is no way to effectively test them without dependencies. You can't easily swap out "piston" with "test piston."
